## Description:
The Dangerous Farm Insects Image Dataset is a curated collection of images featuring 3 different types of insects commonly found in agricultural settings. This dataset provides valuable visual resources for studying, identifying, and understanding the characteristics of these potentially harmful insects. Each insect is represented by multiple high-quality images, showcasing their distinct features, colors, and patterns.

## Models
### 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- CNN is a widely used deep learning architecture for image classification tasks.
- It consists of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers.
- We have implemented a basic CNN architecture for this project.

### 2. InceptionV3
- InceptionV3 is a deep learning architecture that incorporates various convolutional filter sizes within the same layer.
- It is known for its efficiency and has been widely used in image classification tasks.
- We have used a pre-trained InceptionV3 model for transfer learning in this project.

### 3. VGG19
- VGG19 is another deep learning architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness.
- It consists of 19 layers with a combination of convolutional and pooling layers.
- We have used a pre-trained VGG19 model for transfer learning in this project.

## Usage
- The project involves classifying images of dangerous farm insects into different categories.
- We have used the mentioned models to build classifiers that can accurately identify these insects.
- Each model has been trained and evaluated using appropriate datasets.
- The choice of models was based on their performance in similar image classification tasks and their suitability for our dataset.
